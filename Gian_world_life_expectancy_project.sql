SELECT * FROM world_life_expectancy LIMIT 5;

# Step 2. Data Cleaning
	# A. Removing duplicates
	# the plan is to utilize country and year for this
    # as from observation each row is supposed to be country and year from 2007 - 2022. It is not supposed to be duplicated.

	# A.1 using subqueries, concat, groupby, where functions. Identified 3 duplicates (Ireland2022, Senegal2009, Zimbabwe2019)

SELECT *

		COUNT(CONCAT(Country,Year)) AS count_country_year 
		FROM world_life_expectancy
		GROUP BY CONCAT(Country, Year)) AS country_year_table 
WHERE  count_country_year > 1;

	# A.2 Determine which ROW_ID the duplicates are so we can delete it

SELECT *
FROM 	(SELECT row_id,
		CONCAT(Country, Year),
		ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY CONCAT(Country, Year) ORDER BY CONCAT(Country, Year)) AS row_num
        FROM world_life_expectancy) AS row_table
WHERE row_num > 1;

	#A.3 We will delete the rows now because we know row_id 1252, 2265, 2929 holds the duplicate

						FROM world_life_expectancy) AS row_table
				 WHERE row_num > 1);

	# A.4 Try running code A.2, it will be empty as duplicates are deleted.

	# B. Identifying blanks (there are 18 columns)
SELECT * FROM world_life_expectancy;

	# To be safe, run blank checks on all 18 columns. 
    # Conclusion status and life expectancy each have 8 and 2 blanks. Others have 0 but not blanks.
